- 👋 Hi, I’m @bluepaintbook
- 👀 I’m interested in sharing my story.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code, because I don't want to write another book. 
- 💞️ TO EMPLOYERS: please keep in mind that this project was created during a time of extreme stress.
Therefore, I hope that you won't hold it against me (especially since it is marketed as fiction, I have no history of "writing," and I don't enjoy "writing").
- 📫 How to reach me... we'll cross this bridge when we get there.
